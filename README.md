# Hide Workspace

These plugins help hide the workspaces you don't need.

## Getting Started

### Requirement
* Godot Engine 3.x

### Installation
Download and extract the .zip file.

After downloading, open Godot Engine Project Manager. Click Import, go to the extracted folder, and select "project.godot".

## Usage
This asset contains three plugins: "Hide 2D", "Hide 3D" and "Hide AssetLib". To use them, go to Project Settings > Plugins and check one of them or more. The appropriate workspace will then be hidden.

To use this on your project, copy the entire `addons` folder to your project folder.

## Caution
Plugin "Hide AssetLib" should always be included in your project as the rest are extended from it.
